# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently do not maintain older major versions of the sink and backport security fixes. Fixes are usually created as a new release based on the latest existing release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security related problem in the library, please create an issue in the GitHub repository and give us as much details and context as you can.
